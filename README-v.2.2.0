			*     Abing    *
			****************
  
Abing is a tool using the packet pairs dispersion technique to estimate 
the available Bandwidth/bitrate (unused capacity) for a path in the network. 
The code is based on the research results described in the paper J.Navratil, 
R.L. Cottrell "A Practical Approach to Available Bandwidth Estimation" 
presented in PAM'03 (Passive & Active Measurement Workshop), April 6-8 2003 
at La Jolla, California and published in Proceedings issued by San Diego 
Supercomputing Center UCLA San Diego. pp.1-11. 
The method is based on estimating the cross-traffic (or load using a
more common terminology) as a basic parameter. The probing packets are sent 
to the Internet from the abing host with a known separation. We then measure 
the time between delivery of the adjacent packets in a pair. From this we 
calculate the utilization of the bottleneck link and other parameters.

The tool was designed to measure available bandwidth in high capacity 
paths so it can cover all paths with bandwidths between 1-1000 Mbits/s. 
However, for measurements on high speed links, the appropriate hardware 
must be used (e.g. a Linux machine with a clock > 1000MHz and a Gbits/s 
NIC card). The tool is designed to be minimally intrusive and can be run 
over long durations. It sends only 40 probing packets per measurement. 
  
There are 2 programs which are used during each measurement
experiment:
	- reflector(server) that is running on remote site (path destination) 
	- abing (client) which sends probe packet to a reflector, 
	  receive packets from the reflector and makes the analysis

RUNNING 

1) Start reflector at remote_host
	
   abw_rfl &

2) Start abing on your local machine 

   abing -d remote_host


In the interactive mode, the results are delivered to the terminal 
immediately after the bunch of probes (20 packet pairs) has 
traversed the whole path there and back. 

The abing can be run interactively or with a logging option. 
If the logging option  is used the results are written 
into the files in the defined directory. 

You will always get a series of numbers for each direction:
	- ABw   estimated Available Bandwidth (instant value)
	- Xtr   estimated cross-traffic (instant value)
 	- DBC   Dominated Bottleneck Capacity (instant value)
	- ABW   Average of Available BandWidth calculated via EWMA
	- RTT   Round Trip Time (Average Min Max)
 	- PPreport The number of send packet pairs (PP) and the number of received valid PPs 
       


The results are presented in the following form:
timestamp, direction flag, ip-address  and estimated data as shown in 
following lines: 

>abing -d 132.15.144.226 
1086913008 T: 132.15.144.226 ABw-Xtr-DBC: 391.1 608.9 1000.0 ABW: 391.1 Mbps RTT: 251.036 250.823 251.571 ms 20 20
1086913008 F: 132.15.144.226 ABw-Xtr-DBC: 833.7 155.6 989.3 ABW: 833.7 Mbps RTT: 251.036 250.823 251.571 ms 20 20

The meaning of the first two values (ABw-Xtr) is more or less clear. The DBC will be
explained below. The basic relation between the values is as follows:

	ABw = DBC - Xtr

The DBC - Dynamic bottleneck capacity is the capacity of the
the segment in the path (link)  that at the measurement moment is 
causing a bottleneck. Usually the router in this segment is overloaded 
and generates a burst of output packets that are  tightly 
packed/closely spaced. So the DBC gives a measure of the capacity 
of the segment where the cross traffic is highest at the moment of 
measurement. 

In many cases the DBC is determined by the link with the minimum 
transmission rate capacity in the path (because in most cases this 
is the link that cause a traffic congestion). But in the cases 
of the high performance networks (Abilene, ESNET, CALREN, GEANT, etc.) 
where there are no evident narrow links, the DBC gives the 
capacity of the mostly loaded link in the path that dominates 
in traffic limitation. When the path is not extremely loaded, the DBC 
will have a value that approaches the full capacity for such hop 
(e.g. 10, 100, 155, 622 or 1000 Mbits/s). 

We also calculate an average value from all previous values of ABw
using EWMA (Exponentialy Weight Moving Average) formula: 
		ABW=(1-alpha)*ABw + aplha * old_ABw
Default value for factor aplpha is 0.75.

RTT values are in the same structure and order as from the standard ping 
(Min Average Max). They fully correspond to the standard ping values for
packet length 1450 bytes.
 
For a better understanding of the relation between measured values, 
I have included a file with several examples (AB-examples.pdf) describing 
several typical situations on the paths that we are monitoring regularly. 

Running options for reflectors (abw_rfl)
----------------------------------------
There are several options in which reflector can run that give quite high 
flexibility of using it for different type of users.

The running  options for abw_rfl are following:
         -c      calibration (initialization)
         -k      run-keyword
         -s      0,1..n (server mode: default 0 - running in continues mode)
         -m      reflector port number (default 8176)
         -h      Help: produces this output

We discovered that in some cases the reflectors work on very old and slow
machines. To get basic information about a machine performance, we are running
an initialization process, that creates a file in the directory
from which abw_rfl is started. The number in the file shows the minimal
time dispersion of packets (in usec) which can be recognized by this machine.

The whole initialization procedure requiresi the collaboration iof both 
programs (abw_rfl and abing running locally on the same machine). 
You should run following:
./abw_rfl -c &
abing -c
It must be run once (when the reflector is installed). It takes several seconds and
it creates the .localhostname.cal file (1 line with 1 number) in directory 
in which you run these commands.  It depends on the local setting which 
localhostname (if short or long) will be created. (In some special cases 
you can run abing -d localhost instead of -c option.) The file 
.localhostname.cal can be copied to any directory from which you want 
to run abw_rfl. (The abw_rfl require it.)

The keyword option (-k) provides the possibility to restrict monitoring just for
a selected group of users. The keyword is used for blocking response from
the reflector. If abw_rfl is running with the keyword option all clients
(abing users) must use the same keyword when they send the probes.
 
Standard setting uses port 8176. Server (abw_rfl is waiting for probes
on this port). It is more and more usual that network applications are blocked
by firewalls.  You must use the ports  that are not blocked and to use -m option.
If reflector is started with -m option (new port number), the abing must use 
the same number as t is shown in following example. This rule is also valid 
for k option.
 
Example:
        abw_rfl -m 9001 -k freD
        abing -d 134.79.240.27 -m 9001 -n 5 -k freD

The -s option sets the repetitive mode of reflector.
Normally, the reflector works in continuous mode and it responds to all abing
reqeusts comming  from anywhere. If the (-s n) is set, it responds only to n
requests and after that it exits.

./abw_rfl -m 8999 -s 1

All these options can be found by running abw_rfl or abing with the -h  parameter. 


Running options for abing 
-------------------------
>abing -h  
The options are: 
         -d      destination host
         -t      repeating period (1,2,.. sec)
         -n      repeating factor (1,5,100,.. times)
         -m      server port 
         -k      run-keyword (K324a,freD,.. )
         -a      alpha factor in EWMA (default value 0.75)
         -b      number of PP bunches (default number 20)
         -c      calibration mode
         -l      dir (where ABW-node.log and monitoring results will be located)
         -h      Help: produces this output

Some options (d - destination, k - keyword, m - mirror port, a - alpha) have been 
explained in previous text.
Other options are self-explanatory (n - repeating factor or t - period) so we can 
show just simple example of using: 

	abing -d jiri.jn.edu -t 60 -n 100

This will repeat abing to destination node "jiri.jn.edu" 100 times with period 
60 seconds between abing probes.

The abing can be run interactively (default mode) or with a logging option.
If the logging option (-l) is used the results are written into the files in 
the defined directory. There will be 3 files created for each host:
A file called "ABW-machine.log" contains all data since monitoring started.
Files: T-ipaddress.txt and F-ipaddress.txt (The T means "To" and F means "From")
contain the latest monitoring values. The names are created from the ip 
addresses of the machine that responds on abing probes.  

Example:
	abing -d jiri.jn.edu -t 60 -n 100 -l /tmp/MYTEST

ls /tmp/MYTEST 
ABW-jiri.jn.edu.log    F-144.79.24.40.txt   T-144.79.24.40.txt

Remark: the dir for storing monitoring results "/tmp/MYTEST" must exist before
abing is started.

For series of measurements (with option -n) you will get always nx2 lines of 
results and the final summary report:

> abing -d grid2.xyz.edu -m 8999 -n 5
1075925318 T: 131.15.144.226 ABw-Xtr-DBC: 528.1 272.7 800.7 ABW: 528.1 Mbps RTT: 251.275 250.899 253.385 ms 20 20
1075925318 F: 131.15.144.226 ABw-Xtr-DBC: 400.5 414.6 815.2 ABW: 400.5 Mbps RTT: 251.275 250.899 253.385 ms 20 20
1075925319 T: 131.15.144.226 ABw-Xtr-DBC: 525.5 254.1 779.5 ABW: 527.4 Mbps RTT: 251.114 250.888 252.268 ms 20 20
1075925319 F: 131.15.144.226 ABw-Xtr-DBC: 540.9 155.8 696.7 ABW: 435.6 Mbps RTT: 251.114 250.888 252.268 ms 20 20
1075925320 T: 131.15.144.226 ABw-Xtr-DBC: 630.5 280.8 911.4 ABW: 553.2 Mbps RTT: 251.118 250.904 251.341 ms 20 20
1075925320 F: 131.15.144.226 ABw-Xtr-DBC: 462.3 355.2 817.5 ABW: 442.3 Mbps RTT: 251.118 250.904 251.341 ms 20 20
RTT: 251.127 ms ABW(Avg/Sdev) To: 561.351/48.929 From: 467.911/57.435Mbits/s

The summary report gives an average of RTT time, an Average and the Standard
deviation of ABw for measurements (from last  n < 100 results).

The b option allows to run more probes in one serie. It can be used in extreme conditions 
when the path shows heavy packet loss or when we want to get results with higher level 
of statistics. It is obvious that in such case the intrusiveness grows. 

Error reports:
--------------
If the abw_rfl is not running on destination you will get the  message: 
"Connection refused"

>abing -d rhexenor
recvfrom() failed: Connection refused

If the host doesn't exist you will get or "unknown host" or "Terminated" 
message.

>abing -d ja.ty.on
Destination: ja.ty.on: uknown host

>abing -d 137.32.3.99
Terminated

If application is blocked by local firewall, you can get many different 
error reports.  The most typical example of such a situation is the following:
 
>abing -d ato.acr.tech.edu
100 % UDP packet loss
1075858381 T:  ABw-Xtr-DBC: nan nan nan ABW: nan Mbps
1075858381 F:  ABw-Xtr-DBC: nan nan nan ABW: nan Mbps
RTT:  0.000 ms ABW(Avg/Sdev) To:    nan/nan    From:    nan/nan   Mbits/s
